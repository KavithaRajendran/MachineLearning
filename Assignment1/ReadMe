# MachineLearning
Build a binary decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm
• Your program should read four arguments from the command line – complete path of the
training dataset, complete path of the validation dataset, complete path of the test dataset,
and the pruning factor (explained later).
• The datasets can contain any number of Boolean attributes and one Boolean class label. The
class label will always be the last column.
• The first row will define column names and every subsequent non-blank line will contain a
data instance. If there is a blank line, your program should skip it.
