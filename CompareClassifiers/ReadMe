Compare performance of classifiers on a chosen dataset. Below is the list of
classifiers you have learned in class:
• Decision Trees
• Perceptron (usually specified as a neural net with 0 hidden layers)
• Neural Net
• Deep Learning
• SVM
• naïve Bayes
• Logistic Regression
• k-Nearest Neighbors
• Bagging
• Random Forests
• AdaBoost
• Gradient Boosting
The idea is to choose a single dataset and run all of these classifiers on that dataset using the best
set of parameters for each case, and then compare their performance.


Language Used: Python
